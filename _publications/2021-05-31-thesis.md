abstract: "Movies have taught us morals in life and inspired us in many ways possible. However, movies are usually expensive and costly to make. Therefore, we attempt to alleviate the complications involved with movie production by introducing a novel framework for movie generation. Our framework takes in a movie genre as input and generates a movie pertained to that genre as well as a plot that the movie attempts to follow. It consists of two primary components: 1) Controllable Plot Generation: generates the plot pertained to the genre, 2) Video Retrieval: retrieves the most relevant video clips from a database given a plot and combine them into a movie. For Controllable Plot Generation, we found that by using language models and specific attribute classifiers, our model is able to generate fluent and consistent plots that are strongly relevant with the input genre. For Video Retrieval, we built our custom algorithm that matches the plot with the video clips in the dataset by semantic similarity and abstractive summarization techniques. By different means of evaluation, we found that our movie generation framework is able to generate creative movies that is strongly relevant with the input genre and the generated plot."
